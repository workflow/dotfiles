# LLama Not-So-Drama Breakages

## Sound on the XPS 9700

A number of pipewire sinks and sources changed name on this hardware, so I had to adjust my hardcoded sound switcher and sound maintainer scripts.

Also the internal microphone stopped working.

This was due to the [Sound options removal](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/release-notes#sec-release-24.11-migration-sound) no longer persisting ALSA settings, which are needed to [get the internal mic working on the Dell XPS 9700.](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/130882#issuecomment-2584286824)
The [Release Notes](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/release-notes#sec-release-24.11-migration-sound) suggest setting `hardware.alsa.enablePersistence = true;` however that setting [doesn't exist anymore](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/release-22.11/nixos/modules/services/audio/alsa.nix#L25)?

Thankfully with NixOS it's super easy to go and look at the code of what that setting used to do:

```nix
environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.alsa-utils ];
# ALSA provides a udev rule for restoring volume settings.
services.udev.packages = [ pkgs.alsa-utils ];
systemd.services.alsa-store =
  {
     description = "Store Sound Card State";
     wantedBy = [ "multi-user.target" ];
     unitConfig.RequiresMountsFor = "/var/lib/alsa";
     unitConfig.ConditionVirtualization = "!systemd-nspawn";
     serviceConfig = {
       Type = "oneshot";
       RemainAfterExit = true;
       ExecStart = "${pkgs.coreutils}/bin/mkdir -p /var/lib/alsa";
       ExecStop = "${pkgs.alsa-utils}/sbin/alsactl store --ignore";
      };
  };
```

An alternative to using persistence is to run `amixer --card 1 set 'rt715 ADC 24 Mux' 'DMIC3'` after every boot.

Which got me thinking, can Pipewire manipulate ALSA settings like this one? But I couldn't find a simple way.

```

This seemed to have been caused by [Stylix](https://github.com/danth/stylix) doing some assertions in the swaylock module ðŸ‘€ but it was just a red herring. The actual culprit was that Stylix's `image` option, which is still mandatory (see https://github.com/danth/stylix/issues/200) apparently stopped being pured when fed an absolute path.

# Intriguing Changes

## nix flake update

`nix flake update` can now update single inputs - such as the `secrets` in this repo - which feels a lot more ergonomic than the previous `nix flake lock --update-input secrets`

## convertHash

This seems useful: https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.25/language/builtins#builtins-convertHash

## Pipe Operators
